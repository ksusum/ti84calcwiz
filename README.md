## Overview

TI84Calculator Online is a web-based emulator of the Texas Instruments TI-84 series calculators (TI-84 Plus, TI-84 Plus CE). This project provides a clean and intuitive user interface, allowing users to perform calculations, graph functions, and run TI-BASIC programs directly in their web browser without the need for physical hardware.  This project aims to provide an accessible and open-source alternative to existing calculator emulators, focusing on ease of use and a streamlined user experience.

**Key Goals:**

*   **Accessibility:**  Provide a TI-84 calculator experience accessible from any device with a web browser.
*   **Clean UI:**  Offer a modern and intuitive user interface.
*   **TI-BASIC Support:**  Enable users to run existing TI-BASIC programs.
*   **Open Source & Customizable:**  Allow users to modify and contribute to the project.
*   **Educational Resource:**  Serve as a learning tool for mathematics and programming.

## Features

TI84Calculator Online includes the following features:

*   **Fully Functional TI-84 Emulation:**
